We use pnpm, vite, vue 3 with vue-router and mdui 2.
This project used to be use MDUI 2, but now we are migrating to Sober UI (https://soberjs.com).

Use `slot` prop when needed or already written EVEN OUTDATED.

Avoid explaining what you're doing in code comments.

When unnecessary, don't create a bunch of functions to finish a simple task.

After completing all tasks in the request, execute `pnpm check` to check for ts errors and `pnpm pret:fix` to format the code when needed.
